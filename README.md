## App Brainstorming 
### My favorite apps & their features: 
* Goodreads
  * A progress tracker for the books you read
  * A Home page that shows you the reading activity of friends
* Spotify
  * The car Jam feature that allows everyone to queue the songs they like
  * The ability to change the pictures for your playlist
* Yelp
  * A "Surprise Me" feature that randomly recommends a restaurant to a user when they're indecisive
  * Being able to create lists of places with a category that depends entirely on the user
### App idea: 
An app I would like to build is one where family or friends can use to update each other. For instance, 
when a family member comes home, they can open the app and select to notify their family that they have arrived home. 
What I hope this app achieves is for important family/friend updates not to be buried under text messages by creating an app
that is focused on sending those updates. I hope to also include an automatic feature where the app detects the location of the user
and can automatically notify others in the family that they are home. 

## Notes
The challenge I experienced comes mainly from being new to the programming language and changing the name of the app, as it wasn't intuitive.
